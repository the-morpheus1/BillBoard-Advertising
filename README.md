# BillBoard-Advertising
A java based project : It provides approximation about the value of effective traffic one can get by trying different permutations of Bill-Board Placement. 

Assumptions : Attributes contribute to price of BillBoard singularly and regardless of effect of other attributes i.e. a large size board will have same price regardless of the area it is in. 

This is done because the area itself contributes to price.
